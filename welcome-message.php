						<p>
							It gives me immense pleasure to cordially invite you to the 23<sup>rd</sup> Global Conference of Actuaries (GCA) and the Actuarial Gala Function & Awards (AGFA) 2024 scheduled from 12th to 14th February 2024 at The Westin Powai Lake in Mumbai.
						</p><br>
														<p>
															In 2023, GCA made a much-awaited comeback post Covid pandemic and we saw an
								all-time high participation from our members. The line-up of the plenary and concurrent
								sessions covered a wide breadth of the topics such as Sustainability Dialogue, Indian
								Insurance at Amrit Kaal, changing roster of Actuarial Skill set to name a few. The
								keynote address from dignitaries from the Finance Ministry and Insurance Regulator
								which highlighted the Actuarial talent supply gap in Indian insurance was a special
								highlight.</p><br>
								<p>This year, I am looking forward to see the discussions curated around the GCA 2024
								theme “Data, Disruptions and The Actuary”. Advent of Big Data Analytics has brought in a seismic shift in the Insurance landscape and this presents Actuaries with further
								refined tools for risk assessment and modelling. Actuaries have a big role to play in the
								paradigm-altering disruptions in traditional processes particularly relating to
								Underwriting, Pricing and Claims functions.</p>

						<p>  Actuaries can leverage machine learning
								algorithms to identify complex patterns and correlations within the data, enhancing risk
								prediction. Despite the plethora of advantages due to use of Big Data, Actuaries will
								have to strike a balance and weigh in the benefits against the implications for the
								protection of policyholders.</p><br>
														<p>
								It will be interesting to see specialist panels engage in thought-provoking dialogues and
								share key insights on topics of criticality for the insurance, pension and banking
								domains. The GCA offers unique opportunities to connect with dignitaries worldwide
								making it a truly Global forum.</p><br>
														<p>
								I am extremely delighted about the AGFA 2024 (Actuarial Gala Function and Awards),
								the curtain-raiser to the GCA which celebrates the success of our students. I welcome
								you to join me in felicitating our new associates, fellows and academic excellence
								awardees on this prestigious occasion. It is an inspiring moment to witness culmination of the hard work and perseverance of our students. Also, AGFA Performance League
								was launched last year amidst much fanfare on the occasion of AGFA to showcase the
								cultural and four teams of Actuaries dazzled us with fine performances in their bid to win
								the APL trophy and the grand prize. APL will return this year in a more creative avatar
								as the Actuaries put on the hat of the Entertainers once again.</p><br>
														<p>
								The preparations are underway with renewed zeal by the GCA Organizing Group (OG)
								and its sub-groups. I am sure that their hard work will pay off to make this event a grand
								success.</p><br>
														<p>
								Kindly mark your calendar and begin making travel arrangements to be part of this
								thrilling event with us.</p><br>
														<p>
								We look forward to seeing you at the 23<sup>rd</sup> GCA.
